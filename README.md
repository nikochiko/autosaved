# autosave[d]

autosaved, pronounced autosave-d (for autosave daemon) is a utility written in Go to autosave progress on code projects.

It uses the `go-git` package to save snapshots without interfering the normal Git flow - branches that are to be pushed upstream, HEAD, or the Git index.

It provides a command line interface (called `asdi` in v0.1, `autosaved` after that), which can be used to interact with the daemon.

## Usage

You can start the daemon with `autosaved start` or `autosaved start &` if you want it to run in the background. After this you can set a
repository to being watched by running `autosaved watch` from the project directory.

After that, whenever `autosaved` finds uncommitted changes in your Git repository, it will save them on a parallel branch which you can
easily restore. Find more information in [How it works](#how-it-works).

## Recovery

To recover something, you can grab its commit hash from `autosaved list` and run `autosaved restore <commit-hash>`.

I have done it in this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFgLyTNwHu4

## Installation

If you have Golang setup, you can directly install it with `go install github.com/nikochiko/autosaved`

You can download a binary from the v0.2 release:
https://github.com/nikochiko/autosaved/releases/tag/v0.2 for your architecture and OS

Currently, I have only added 3 binaries for linux/amd64, windows/amd64, and darwin/amd64.

This is because that's what came with [`gox`](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox), which I used to package the release binaries.
If you have a darwin/arm or something else, don't fret. It's super
easy to build it yourself. I used go 1.17, but it may be compatible
with some older versions too. Simply `go build` to get the binary.

Once you have the binary, you can just `mv` it to a bin/ folder.

```bash
# for example
sudo mv autosaved_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/autosaved
```

### Setup

To get it working, you'll have to setup the daemon first. It can be
activated with `autosaved start` in any normal terminal, but you may want to run it on
[`systemd`](#systemd) or `screen` to keep it alive through failures and restarts.

Once that's done you're all ready. Just `cd` into your project
directory and run `autosaved watch`, this will notify the daemon to start
watching the directory.

It does so by adding the repository's full path to the configuration (by default `~/.config/.autosaved.yaml` or under the path define by environment variable `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`), which gets picked up by
Viper on the fly.

#### Systemd

A sample systemd unit file can be found here: [autosaved.service](autosaved.service).

To add it to systemd, you can do the following steps:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikochiko/autosaved/main/autosaved.service

# vim/nano/vscode into autosaved.service
# change these two lines to your own username
User=kaustubh # your own pc username
Group=kaustubh # your own pc username

# once that's done, close the editor
# move the service to systemd's home
sudo mv autosaved.service /etc/systemd/system/autosaved.service

# enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable autosaved.service
sudo systemctl start autosaved.service

# to check whether it's running properly, you can run
sudo systemctl status autosaved.service
```

## Configuration

The configuration too comes with very usable defaults. `autosaved` will traverse all the `watched` repositories
every 2 minutes by default. This is defined by the `checking_interval` config option.

The other option is `after_every:`, this option defines how long
after one commit/autosave should we wait until we autosave the next time in each repository.
The `minutes` and `seconds` options inside this will get
added up. For example, 1 minute and 2 seconds would give 62 seconds
as the minimum time to wait before autosaving the same repository.

Finally, the `repositories` part is how `autosaved` remembers which repositories to keep an eye on.
This may be modified manually or by doing `autosaved watch` in a Git
project.

```yaml
checking_interval: 120
after_every:
  minutes: 2
  seconds: 0
repositories:
  - /home/kaustubh/Desktop/projects/autosaved
```

## Commands

- `autosaved start`: Starts the daemon
- `autosaved stop`: Stops the daemon gracefully
- `autosaved save`: Saves uncommitted changes in a repository manually. This may be
  useful when you are not using the daemon, or when you are too
  impatient to wait for its next cycle. This command doesn't need the daemon to be running.
- `autosaved restore <commit-hash>`: Restores the changes from a checkpoint committed by autosaved. The checkpoints stay
  outside the main refs, and don't interfere with the staging
  index or current branch.
- `autosaved watch`: Starts watching a file path. This will add the repository's path to the config file. If the daemon is active,
  it won't need a restart to pick this up.
- `autosaved unwatch`: Opposite of watch. This will remove the repository's path from the config file. If the daemon is active,
  it won't need a restart to pick this up.
- `autosaved list <N>`: Shows N (by default, 10) max commits starting
  from HEAD. It will show the commits made by user more widely,
  and then the autosave commits that were made on top of that
  commit will be displayed like bullet points and numbered so it
  is easy to make sense of the list.

## How it works

After a repository is added to the watching list with `autosaved watch`, the autosave daemon will poll it every $checking_interval
seconds for uncommitted changes.

If it finds any, it will commit the changes to a parallel branch. This branch will be named like `_asd_<commit-hash>`. Any
further changes that you make without committing manually will
go into newer commits on this parallel branch.

The branch names start with `_asd_` so that when sorted alphabetically
these will sit at the top and you can then
scroll down to your relevant branches when you list with `git branch`.

It uses `go-git` for all the Git operations, which is a pure
Go implementation of Git. It is independent of the local
Git being used on the user's system. This shields against
unforeseen bugs caused due to differing versions of Git.

The restore process is simple. It does two things:

1. Checkout to the commit checkpoint. This will restore the filesystem to checkpoint. \* Note: For all releases until now, this is a forced-checkout, i.e. it will overwrite local changes in favor of the branch that
   is being checked out. This behavior may change in the future
   to throw an error when user has unstaged changes.
2. [Keep-checkout](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5#CheckoutOptions) to the original branch. This will
   checkout the original branch now, while keeping all the changes that are
   currently in the filesystem. This is the opposite of force. It will keep changes in the worktree and staging during checkout.
